**We changed from an unordered list to an ordered list**

1. mkdir - creates a directory 
2. cd - lets us change into the directory 
3. ls - lists files in the directory (ls -la to look for .git) 
4. git clone - which cloned the repository which was created on GitHub to our local directory 
5. git remote -v - which shows us the connection between our remote and our local 
6. touch - to create a markdown file called awesome_page.md 
7. subl [file] - to open the file we created on our text editor 
8. git status - to check the current state of our repository 
9. git branch - to check the existing branches 
10. git co -b [branch name] - to create a feature branch

`This was originally in the README.md file and is now being duplicated into the awesome_page.md file.`
