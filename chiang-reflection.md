##GPS 1.1 - Version Control and Git
###Reflection file by Eric Chiang (April 28, 2017)

**1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

* Remembering the exact format of certain git terminal commands
* When to use the remote function
* Remembering my GitHub password!!!

**2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

* How to manually resolve merge conflicts
* How different people work independently on the same repository and then push/pull/merge their changes

**3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

* Questions about formatting and shorthand commands
* Being driver and navigator for GPS assignments
* What to turn in
* What to focus on in the assignment

**4. What still confuses you about Git?**

* We took a screenshot, saved it as a PNG file, and pushed/pulled it to GitHub. The instructions mention displaying it inline and linking to it, but we weren't 100% sure how to do this. Our guide told us this was not something we should spend too much time figuring out, so this is something I am not completely sure how to do.
* Why does a given person both push and pull? You would think that one person pushes and then someone else pulls. It's probably just an issue of terminology but it seems a little counterintuitive.

**5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

* Great! It was fantastic working with Abraham and with Blake observing.
