# Reflection file

1. **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
*Prior to the GPS when I first began practicing the GitHub work flow I was under the impression that after working on our local feature branch that we had to merge that branch into our local master and then push our local master. However I learned the correct steps were that we pushed from our feature branch up to our remote master on GitHub.*

2. **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
*The difference between `git fetch` and `git pull` was clarified for me. Fetching gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in your current branch. and stores them in your local repository, whereas a pull would merge them with your current branch.*

3. **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
*The questions that I had for both my pair and guide were related to the steps in the GPS 1.1 assignment. They were mostly clarification questions so that we were on track.*

4. **What still confuses you about Git?**
*There isn't anything at the moment that confuses me about Git but I do there are commands and features that I still don't know about which I would like to learn eventually.*

5. **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
*I enjoyed the GPS very much and it was fun to work with my pair and have the guide watch over us to make sure we were on track.*
